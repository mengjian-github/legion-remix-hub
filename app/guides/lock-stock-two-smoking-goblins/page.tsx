            Legion Remix layers add Bronze-friendly extras, but the base unlock still flows through Gazrix, making the Lock,

                announces the A “Noble” Event. Gazrix Gearlock parks his zeppelin for roughly five minutes; hand in

                Fly to <strong>Watchman’s Rock</strong> in Stormheim (54.8, 41.1) where Hemet sets up a forward camp. A

                drop a summon stone for friends—Legion Remix shards reward extra Bronze for the escort trash, and every minute

                Once the zeppelin arrives interact with Hemet’s harpoon to catapult aboard. Keep both goblins health pools
                within 10% of each other; if more than 60 seconds pass between kills the reward crate can despawn. Drop DoTs on
                the first target, swap often, and save executes for the final 15% so Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Goblins Legion Remix finishes award the chest every time.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Still seeing the <strong>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Goblins not spawning</strong> bug? Follow these fixes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-300">
            <li>Swap to <code className="text-xs">/1 Custom</code> group finder shards; the quest objects reappear instantly on fresh shards.</li>
            <li>Abandon and reaccept the quest after speaking with Hemet to refresh the objective tracker.</li>
            <li>Disable phasing addons like Cross RP that can desync you from the Remix layer.</li>
            <li>Log completely out if the objective counter is stuck at 0/1 after jumping off the zeppelin; a clean reload repositions Hemet.</li>
            <li>If the reward cache fails to spawn, double-check both goblins died within 60 seconds—reset and execute together.</li>
            <li>Pet classes should dismiss companions before boarding; lingering pets can keep you in combat and block the completion check.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-300">
            When all else fails, hearth to the Infinite Bazaar and use the Legion Remix website portal network to re-enter Stormheim.
            Blizzard hotfixes usually reset the Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Goblins Legion Remix goblin routes every 30 minutes.
